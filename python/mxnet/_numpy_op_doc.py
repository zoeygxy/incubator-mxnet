def _np_reshape(a, newshape, order='C'):
    """
    reshape(a, newshape, order='C')

    Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Array to be reshaped.
    newshape : int or tuple of ints
        The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
        an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
        One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is
        inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
    order : {'C'}, optional
        Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the
        elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
        means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,
        with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
        axis index changing slowest. Other order types such as 'F'/'A'
        may be added in the future.

    Returns
    -------
    reshaped_array : ndarray
        It will be always a copy of the original array. This behavior is different
        from the official NumPy package where views of the original array may be
        generated.

    repeats : int or array of ints
        The number of repetitions for each element.  `repeats` is broadcasted
        to fit the shape of the given axis.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to repeat values.  By default, use the

    Return the cumulative sum of the elements along a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. The default
        (None) is to compute the cumsum over the flattened array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  If `dtype` is not specified, it defaults
        to the dtype of `a`.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape, type and buffer length as the expected output.

    Returns
    -------
    cumsum_along_axis : ndarray.
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which case a reference to `out` is returned. The
        result has the same size as `a`, and the same shape as `a` if

def _np_dot(a, b, out=None):
    """dot(a, b, out=None)

    Dot product of two arrays. Specifically,
    
    - If both `a` and `b` are 1-D arrays, it is inner product of vectors
    
    - If both `a` and `b` are 2-D arrays, it is matrix multiplication,
    
    - If either `a` or `b` is 0-D (scalar), it is equivalent to :func:`multiply`
      and using ``np.multiply(a, b)`` or ``a * b`` is preferred.
    
    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is a 1-D array, it is a sum product over
      the last axis of `a` and `b`.
    
    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is a 2-D array, it is a
      sum product over the last axis of `a` and the second-to-last axis of `b`::
    
        dot(a, b)[i,j,k] = sum(a[i,j,:] * b[:,k])

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        First argument.
    b : ndarray
        Second argument.
    
    out : ndarray, optional
        Output argument. It must have the same shape and type as the expected output.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        Returns the dot product of `a` and `b`.  If `a` and `b` are both
        scalars or both 1-D arrays then a scalar is returned; otherwise

def _np_sum(a, axis=0, dtype=None, keepdims=None, initial=None, out=None):
    r"""
    sum(a, axis=None, dtype=None, keepdims=_Null, initial=_Null, out=None)

    Sum of array elements over a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input data.
    axis : None or int, optional
        Axis or axes along which a sum is performed.  The default,
        axis=None, will sum all of the elements of the input array.  If
        axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed. The default type is float32.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `sum` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-classes `sum` method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    initial: Currently only supports None as input, optional
        Starting value for the sum.
        Currently not implemented. Please use ``None`` as input or skip this argument.
    out : ndarray or None, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape and dtype as the expected output.

    Returns
    -------
    sum_along_axis : ndarray
        An ndarray with the same shape as `a`, with the specified
        axis removed. If an output array is specified, a reference to
        `out` is returned.

    Notes
    -----
    - Input type does not support Python native iterables.
    - "out" param: cannot perform auto type change. out ndarray's dtype must be the same as the expected output.
    - "initial" param is not supported yet. Please use None as input.
    - Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is raised on overflow.
    - The sum of an empty array is the neutral element 0:

    >>> a = np.empty(1)
    >>> np.sum(a)
    array(0.)

    This function differs from the original `numpy.sum
    <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html>`_ in
    the following aspects:

    - Input type does not support Python native iterables(list, tuple, ...).
    - "out" param: cannot perform auto type cast. out ndarray's dtype must be the same as the expected output.
    - "initial" param is not supported yet. Please use ``None`` as input or skip it.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([0.5, 1.5])
    >>> np.sum(a)
    array(2.)
    >>> a = np.array([0.5, 0.7, 0.2, 1.5])
    >>> np.sum(a, dtype=np.int32)
    array(2, dtype=int32)
    >>> a = np.array([[0, 1], [0, 5]])
    >>> np.sum(a)
    array(6.)
    >>> np.sum(a, axis=0)
    array([0., 6.])
    >>> np.sum(a, axis=1)
    array([1., 5.])

    With output ndarray:

    >>> a = np.array([[0, 1], [0, 5]])
    >>> b = np.ones((2,), dtype=np.float32)
    >>> np.sum(a, axis = 0, out=b)
    array([0., 6.])
    >>> b
    array([0., 6.])

    If the accumulator is too small, overflow occurs:

    >>> np.ones(128, dtype=np.int8).sum(dtype=np.int8)
    array(-128, dtype=int8)

    pass


def  _np_copy(a, out=None):
    """
    copy(a, out=None)

    Return an array copy of the given object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input data.
    out : ndarray or None, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape and dtype as the expected output.

    Returns
    -------
    arr : ndarray
        Array interpretation of `a`.

    Notes
    -------
    This function differs from the original `numpy.copy
    <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.copy.html>`_ in
    the following aspects:

    - Input type does not support Python native iterables(list, tuple, ...).
    - ``out`` param: cannot perform auto broadcasting. ``out`` ndarray's shape must be the same as the expected output.
    - ``out`` param: cannot perform auto type cast. ``out`` ndarray's dtype must be the same as the expected output.
    - Does not support "order" parameter.

    Examples
    --------
    Create an array x, with a reference y and a copy z:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> y = x
    >>> z = np.copy(x)

    Note that, when ``x`` is modified, ``y`` is also modified, but not ``z``:

    bitwise_and(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj])

    Compute the bit-wise AND of two arrays element-wise.

    Computes the bit-wise AND of the underlying binary representation of
    the integers in the input arrays. This ufunc implements the C/Python
    operator ``&``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1, x2 : ndarray
        Types are cast to integer for calculation.
    out : ndarray or None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Result. `float32` type by default.

    Notes
    -------
    This function differs from the original `numpy.copy
    <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.copy.html>`_ in
    the following aspects:
    - Input type does not support Python native iterables(list, tuple, ...).
    - Accepts float type input, but the input will be cast to int64 type for calculation
    - Output type is `float32` by default.


    Examples
    --------
    The number 13 is represented by ``00001101``.  Likewise, 17 is
    represented by ``00010001``.  The bit-wise AND of 13 and 17 is
    therefore ``000000001``, or 1:

    >>> x1 = np.array(13)
    >>> x2 = np.array(17)
    >>> np.bitwise_and(x1, x2)
    array(1.)
